## Flagship Project

### Production-Oriented Fraud Risk Detection System

- Designed a leakage-controlled fraud detection pipeline on **6.3M+ financial transactions**, addressing extreme class imbalance (**0.13% fraud rate**) using SMOTE and class-weight strategies with Precision–Recall and PR-AUC evaluation.
- Optimised decision thresholds to reduce false negatives in high-risk scenarios, with governance-aligned validation and model risk documentation for production readiness.

## Work Experience

### Shift Manager (Operations Analysis) @ Slim Chickens
Nov 2024 – Present | Guildford, United Kingdom

- Applied data-driven performance analysis by integrating EPOS transaction data with payment records using **Power Query** and **structured reconciliation models**. Designed automated validation workflows for financial reporting, reducing reconciliation errors by 30%.
- Transaction-level analysis improved service efficiency by 15% and supported a 10% increase in peak-hour sales.

### Graduate Engineer Trainee (Data Analyst) @  HCL Tech
Dec 2022 - June 2023 | Delhi, India 

- Processed and validated large, multi-source operational and pricing datasets using Python (Pandas) and SQL, and developed short-term pricing and trend forecasts by applying **Linear Regression and time-based analysis** on cleaned data, enabling more accurate forecasting and data-driven pricing decisions.  
- Automated end-to-end data preparation, extraction, and reporting by integrating **SQL pipelines, Python scripts, and Excel workflows**, delivering operational insights through Power BI dashboards and reducing manual processing time by 30%.

  <p class="project-desc">
    Designed a <strong>Monte Carlo-based</strong> financial risk simulation engine to model portfolio return distributions under uncertain market conditions. Generated thousands of stochastic return paths, computed <strong>Value at Risk (VaR)</strong> and <strong>Conditional VaR</strong>, and quantified downside exposure using probabilistic modelling techniques. Built with modular architecture to support scalable stress testing and scenario analysis for financial decision-making.
