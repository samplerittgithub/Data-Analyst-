## Work Experience

### Shift Manager (Operations Analysis) @ Slim Chickens
Nov 2024 – Present | Guildford, United Kingdom

- Applied data-driven performance analysis by integrating EPOS transaction data with payment records using **Power Query** and **structured reconciliation models**. Designed automated validation workflows for financial reporting, reducing reconciliation errors by 30%.
- Transaction-level analysis improved service efficiency by 15% and supported a 10% increase in peak-hour sales.

### Graduate Engineer Trainee (Data Analyst) @  HCL Tech
Dec 2022 - June 2023 | Delhi, India 

- Processed and validated large, multi-source operational and pricing datasets using Python (Pandas) and SQL, and developed short-term pricing and trend forecasts by applying **Linear Regression and time-based analysis** on cleaned data, enabling more accurate forecasting and data-driven pricing decisions.  
- Automated end-to-end data preparation, extraction, and reporting by integrating **SQL pipelines, Python scripts, and Excel workflows**, delivering operational insights through Power BI dashboards and reducing manual processing time by 30%.

## Selected Projects

### Cloud-Based Financial Risk Simulation Platform  
[View Repository →](https://github.com/yourusername/financial-risk-simulation-platform)

Designed a **Monte Carlo-based** financial risk simulation engine to model portfolio return distributions under uncertain market conditions. Generated thousands of stochastic return paths, computed **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional VaR**, and quantified downside exposure using probabilistic modelling techniques. Built with modular architecture to support scalable stress testing and scenario analysis for financial decision-making.

---

### Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis (BERT + LSTM)  
[View Repository →](https://github.com/yourusername/multi-aspect-sentiment-analysis)

Developed a deep learning pipeline for aspect-level sentiment classification using contextual **BERT embeddings** combined with **LSTM sequence modelling**. Extracted granular sentiment signals within multi-opinion text, optimised precision-recall trade-offs, and benchmarked performance against traditional ML baselines to improve explainable sentiment intelligence for customer feedback analytics.

---

### Diabetes Prediction Model  
[View Repository →](https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-model)

Built a supervised classification pipeline to predict diabetes risk using structured clinical indicators. Applied feature engineering, cross-validation, and comparative modelling across **logistic regression**, **random forest**, and **gradient boosting** approaches. Prioritised recall optimisation for high-risk case detection to support early intervention insights.

### Information Security Risk Assessment Framework  
[View Repository →](https://github.com/yourusername/information-security-risk-framework)

Designed a quantitative risk scoring framework aligned with governance and compliance standards. Developed a structured evaluation matrix assessing **likelihood**, **impact**, and **vulnerability** to generate prioritised risk rankings mapped to control frameworks. Enables systematic, auditable risk prioritisation for governance-aligned decision-making.
